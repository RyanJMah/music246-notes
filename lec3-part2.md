# Lecture 3 (Part 2)

### The Silent Era

**Melodrama**
* Back in the day, most plays didn't have music
* There was a separate thing which did
    * They had lots of music, kinda like film scores

**The persistence of vision:**
* If you project a series images in front of a human being at a very fast rate, we perceive it as a continuous motion
    * Around 11 FPS
    * As you increase the frame-rate, eventually our brains will fill in the gaps
* Project several images to present the illusion of movement

### Thomas Edison
* The Kinetoscope (1891)
    * Peephole viewer with a continuous loop of film
    * Kinda like an arcade box
* The Kinetophone (1895)
    * A kinetoscope with a photograph installed in the box
    * Synchronization problems
        * Music was out of sync with picture

### First Projected Films
**The Lumiere Brothers, Paris, December 28th, 1895**
* They are credited with the invention of the motion picture
* They presented the images onto a wall
    * Way better than Kinetophone
* At this point, still not narrative
    * A demonstration of technology

Example: "The Arrival of a Train"
* This "film" has a piano backing
* When this technology first appeared, at the showings, the Lumiere Brothers hired musicians to play along to the films

### Reasons for Musical Accompaniment
1. Pragmatic Reasons
    * Mechanical noise / mechanical problems
        * The projectors would break a lot
        * Musicians enterained audience while they fixed the projector

<br>

2. Psychoanalytic Reasons
    * Audience disturbed ghost like images
        * Back in the day, people would probably be a little creeped out by the film
        * New, and kinda like uncanny valley vibes
            * No sound, color, whatever
    * Addition of music probably helped some of this creepiness

<br>

3. Continuity of Tradition
    * Long history of musical accompaniment for visual presentation.

#### During the Silent Era
Three general approaches to music:
1. Adaptation/compilations of classical music
2. Adaptation/compilations of popular songs
3. Originally composed scores or improvised scores
    * Very rare

In general, films could be shown anywhere, but gradually certain venues come
to dominate film showings.

### Venues
* Vaudeville theatres
    * Live variety show
        * Some nights there would be musicians, plays, dancers, etc.
        * Different performance each night
    * They started to show motion pictures in 1896
    * Musical accompaniment provided by Vaudeville orchestra
    * By 1920s, the popularity of film led to the decline of Vaudeville

<br>

* "Nickelodeons" (1905)
    * Could be anywhere
        * ex., If a storefront was abandonded, someone would rent it out
    * Called a "Nickelodeon" because it costed just a nickel
    * Become very popular
        * 1907 - 3000 Nickelodeons
        * 1910 - Over 10,000
    * Music provided by piano, player piano, small ensemble or gramophone
        * "Player Piano" - a piano that can play itself mechanically (like a music box)

### A Shift to Narrative
**George Melis:**
* First person to experiment with telling a narrative with film
    * Would paint sets, get actors in costume, etc.
* Early experimenter with camera effects

**Example: A Trip to the Moon (1902)**
* Bad piano improvisation lol
* In colour
    * Comes along in 1910s ish, but very expensive
    * Frames were hand-painted

**1905 - 1910:**
* Narrative films become the most important element
    * Films become longer
    * Plots become more complex
* There is a recognition that the music could play an active role in the narrative
* Change in musical aesthetic from entertaining the audience to "playing the picture"
    * Supporting the drama and helping the audience to follow the plot
    * "Fitting" or **"Synchronizing"**

**1910 - 1920s**
* Film industry matures
* Thomas Edison used his political influence to take out patents on basically every element involved in film making
    * You are legally obligated to pay Thomas Edison if you wanted to make, or show a movie
* The rise of Hollywood
    * In Hollywood, the local judges refused to enforce Thomas Edison's patents
    * Every film maker moved there, and Hollywood becomes the center of the film industry
    * Hollywood was in California, which had many great places for location shooting
        * Photographic countryside
* Films become longer, more sophisticated 

<br>

* First of the "Movie Palaces" built, 1912
    * Very elaborate theatres built to show movies
* "Orchestra pit"
    * Place near the start of the theatre where the orchestra goes
* "Theatre Organs"
    * Could quickly change the timbre
    * Had mechanisms to do sound effects
        * Door sounds, wind machines, blank pistols, etc.

### Accompaniment
Some early attempts at creating original scores, but standard practice is either
compilation of classical or popular music, or improvisation.

Two approaches:

1. **Send the music with the film**
    * 1909 - Edison Film Company - "musical suggestions"
        * General scene-by-scene suggestios for musical accompaniment
        * The first cue sheets
    * 1912 - Max Winkler (Carl Fischer Music)
        * Specific piece of music with timings
            * Timestamps
        * Films shipped with the cue sheets, might also include sheet music
    * Problem: The film canisters would be shipped from theatre to theatre
        * Sometimes, people would forget to put the sheet music back
        * Spill coffee, etc.
        * Eventually, there was no more sheet music

<br>

2. **Resource books**
    * Books purchased by musicians filled with short pieces of music arranged by mood or action
        * Kinda like a real book but for scores I guess
    * ex., "Music for Duels", "Music for Storms"

#### Trade Papers
* *Motion Picture World, Moving Picture World*
* Included articles and columns on musical accompaniment
* **Photo-play musicians (good accompanists):**
    * Continuous
    * Source music
        * If you see someone in a war blowing a bugel, the music should sound like it
    * Use of themes
        * Leitmotifs
    * "Good music" (classical music) to the masses
        * Whether or not to include pop music
        * "Pop music isn't good for the masses, classical music is true art though"

In 1920s, musical accompaniment would still vary greatly from place to place:
* Vast range of performing skills
* Missing cue sheets and scores
* Issues of "control"
    * Musicians would get the score sheets and wouldn't like it, so they would do their own thing

One solution to the problem:
* Technical problem
* Need to be able to record audio next to the film
