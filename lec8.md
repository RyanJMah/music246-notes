## The 1950s:
* End of the studio system
    * It was illegal
    * Studios were basically monopolies
* Challenge of new media - Television

### Battle with television fought on two fronts:

#### Technology
* Wider aspect ratios
    * The norm used to be 4:3
    * Couldn't get that kind of image on a television
    * Many systems in competition
        * CinemaScope, Panavision, Vista Vision
* Multi-channel sound systems for theatres

Many movies were made to specifically take advantage of new technology.

* Epic films:
    * Quo Vadis
    * The Robe
    * Julius Ceasar
    * Lawrence of Arabia
    * Cleopatra
    * The Ten Commandments

**EXAMPLE: Ben Hur (1959), Music by Miklos Rozsa**
* Visually spectacular / no narrative development during this scene
    * Focus is on the grandeur of the sound and image
* Music is tonal / orchestral    

#### Subject Matter
* March 1930: The Production Code (Hays Office)
    * Voluntary until 1934
    * Television more restricted - advertisers
    * A lot of people don't like it, and people start to break the code more and more
    * Foreign films
        * European films less concerned with being PG-13
        * European films deal with adult topics
            * American film studios feel like the need to be competitive
    * Abandoned in 1968
        * Introduces age-based rating systems
