## The 1980s

* Strongly influenced by the work of John Williams
* Composers moving back to the orchestra as a starting point
* Dominant musical style is neo-romantic fused with elements of modernism
* Main themes tend to be tonal
* Notable composers who become prominent during this period are James Horner,
  Michael Kamen, and Alan Silvestri

**EXAMPLE: Back to the Future (1985) - Music by Alan Silvestri**
* Film is a comedy but the music treats it as a serious story
    * The juxtaposition is what makes it work
* Listen to the similarity between the work of Silvestri and Williams
    * Very much "neo-romantic"
        * Lush (romantic) melodies, with atonal moments of chaos

Silvestri's recent work includes scores for The Avengers.

## James Horner (1953 - 2015)
* Born in Los Angeles
* Father Harry was an Academy Award winning set designer / art director
* Grew up in England where he attended the Royal College of Music
* Returns to LA in his teens
* Despite the fact that his father worked in the film industry, Horner felt
  that film composing was not a serious artistic outlet
* Began composing for film while at UCLA in 1978 for the
  American Film Institute (AFI)

First major film score: **The lady in Red (1979)**

Breakthrough score was for **Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan**

* Among his best known work:
    * Aliens (1986)
    * Field of Drams (1989)
    * Braveheart (1995)
    * Apollo 13 (1996)

<br>

* Greatest success came in 1997: **Titanic** for which he won two
  academy awards (Best original score, best original song - "My Heart
  Will Go On" - Lyrics by Will Jennings)
    * The recording of the original score is still considered the best-selling
      orchestral album of all time

**Characteristics of Horner's Style**
* Strong melodic composer, often works with the conventional orchestra
* Both neo-romantic and modernist sounds in his work
* Also capable of incorporating electronic instrument and effects

<br>

* Despite not having a strong background in Popular music, is also adept at
  writing in popular styles - "My Heart Will Go On" with Celine Dion

<br>

* Very strong at synchronizing music to visual elements such as scene
  and camera changes - **hitting the cuts** (not Mickey Mousing)

**Example: Glory (1989)**
* Focusses on an arm unit for the North side of the US civil war
    * The first all-black unit
    * They still face racism in the North, just as much as in South

<br>

* **Hitting the cuts**
    * Close synchronization of music with camera "cuts"
    * Cut - changes of point of view or scene
* Electronic processing of trumpet and snare to create sense of historical distance
* What "instrument" is used to carry the main theme?

## Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982)

Music by James Horner.

Score is primarily orchestral and tonal. Also includes some modernist elements
and electronic instruments.

An attempt to go back to Star Trek's more light-hearted, action-y roots. As
opposed to the very intellectual previous movie.

**EXAMPLE: Main Theme**
* Starts with electronic instruments

<br>

* The Star Trek outfits are based off of the English navy outfits in the 1700s
    * Many creative elements follow in this vain
    * The battles happen when the space ships go side by side and then they
      each fire their cannons
    * Horner's score reflects this as well, sounds exactly like Korngold
        * Old-fashioned, romantic score

<br>

* The "Star Trek" Theme is grand and lyrical but lacks an "action hero" quality
    * Much more laid back
    * Why?
        * The film is very sentimental and nostalgic, theme reflects this
        * "The film is about people getting older and no longer being
          the people they used to be" - Prof

**EXAMPLE: Leaving Space Dock**
* A strong fanfare - exterior shots of the ship coming to life - music and
  camera cuts are closely synced
* Music volume drops down as Kirk enters the bridge - wonder and excitement,
  uncertainty
* The music begins a new statement of the theme as Spock asks a cadet officer
  to "take her out." Intended as comedy with Kirk's nervious reaction,
  but Horner does not break the mood of the music. In a way, it makes the
  moment funnier than if he had tried to play it
* Music builds with closeup exterior shot of the Enterprise
* Full statement of main theme synced to full shot of the Enterprise

**EXAMPLE: Khan**
* Modernism for Khan's reveal
    * Atonal clusters and means gradually build until we see his face for
      the first time
* The music changes to a slow but relentless pulse
    * Theme is based on semitones: a first glimpse into the obsession of Khan
* As the narrative developers, the slow pulse and its accompanying theme of
  semitones will grow into a fierce and dreadful articulation of Khan's rage

**EXAMPLE: Surprise Attack**
* Battle between Kirk and Khan - also a "battle" between the musical themes
* Dominance of Khan's theme foreshadowing the attack
* Kirk's theme gradually overwhelmed
* Once the attack begins, nothing but variations of Khan's theme
* Finally, Kirk's theme returns in minor (thematic variation) with the
  demand for surrender

**EXAMPLE: Kirks' Reply**
* "Clear The Bridge" music is quiet and uncertain, but the rhythm suggests
  order and precision of Kirk, rather than the vengeance of Khan.
    * Does Kirk have a plan?

<br>

* Exterior, Khan's theme, but no longer clear and focused
* When do we hear Kirk's theme return to the score?
    * When he puts the reading glasses on, accepts his age...

## James Horner (Cont.)

An avid pilot for most of his life, Horner was killed in a single-engine 
plane crash in 2015. He has just ompleted initial work on a score for the
remake of a western called "The Magnificent Seven (2016)". He was 61.

## Electronic Scores

* By the 1950s, electronic music had become an important part of musical modernism
* RCA Synthesizer - Colombia University
    * "Arbitrary" frequency response
        * Can do basically anything

<br>

* "Realization"
    * You don't "play" the synth, you "realize" the melody on it
    * You program it

<br>

Synths allows some composers who normally wouldn't be able to get into film scoring
to do it:
* Self-taught musicians
    * Don't need to be able to read sheet music

**EXAMPLE: "Ensembles for Synthesizer" (1964) - Composed by Milton Babbit**

* By the mid 1960s, smaller "modular" synths were replacing the earlier
  larger models
* In 1964, Bob Moog produces the first commercially available modular synthesizer

## Wendy Carlos (1939-)
**Switched on Bach (1968)**
* Re-created a Bach symphony electronically
* Popularized the synth in popular culture

Film scores included:
* A Clockwork Orange (1971)
* The Shining (1980)
* Tron (1982)

Using synthesizers but still in the orchestral tradition.

#### Late 1960s, early 1970s
* Musicians working in popular styles begin to experiment with synths
* Emergence of progressive from and early electronica, both made use of
  extended instrumental works

**Sorcerer (1977)**
* Music by electronic music pioneers "Tangerine Dream"

**Halloween (1978)**
* Music by director John Carpenter

The music is based on a "vamp".

## Vangelis (1943 - 2022)
* Born in Greece
* Largely self-taught
* Created music by layering instruments one at a time
* **Chariots of Fire (1981)**
* **Blade Runner (1982)**

**EXAMPLE: Blade Runner**
* Film is a science fiction, but heavily influenced by the style of film noir
* Synthesizers creating a lush, spacious sound

By early 1980s, synths have become smaller, more powerful, and more affordable

* 1983: MIDI
* When combined with a personal computer it is possible for a single musician to
  produce long, complex works (such as a film score) without the need of an
  expensive recording studio

Will also allow composers with little or no technical training to work out
complex ideas including music for orchestra without the need for written notation.

Why use a real orchestra?
