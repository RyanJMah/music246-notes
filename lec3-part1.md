# Lecture 3 (Part 1)

### Basic Timetable of File Production

**Pre-production**
* Preparation: script / financing / casting / costume and set design / location scouting

**Production**
* Finalization of script and production design
* Principle photography

**Post-production**
* Editing film/audio and visual effects
* Composition and addition of music - release date
    * Studio promises it will release on a certain date (lol)
    * They've like spent a lot of money and stuff, needs to be ready
    * Very common for composers to get very little time
* One of the final elements to be created and added to the film
* 5 to 8 weeks on average

Composer's involvement varies based on working style and specifics of a given project.

Scripts:
* Can give composers a "head-start"
* Research
* Source music
    * Are people gonna be singing?
    * Pop songs used?

Generally, won't rely on the script too much
* scripts can change significantly
* only words, no clear timing or pace for the composer to work with

**Screenings**
* Several different opportunities to see the film
* Rushes
    * Stuff that isn't good?
* Assembly cut
    * First version of the film the director puts together
    * Usually a lot longer than the actual movie
* Rough cut
    * I missed this oof
* Fine or locked cut: most if not all editing completed
    * The director says "ok, I'm pretty sure that this is what I want"
* Most composers begin serious work at the fine cut phase, why?
    * Timings are all finally nailed down
    * Composers want to experience the film the same way the audience does
        * Better inspiration I guess

**Spotting Session and Cue Sheets**
* Director, composer, music editor/music supervisor
    * Editor is there, making very detailed notes of the meeting
* Discussion on placement of "cues"
    * Where music should start, stop, etc.
* Timings, approach, etc.
* "Spotting notes" or cue sheet
    * Drafted by music editor at the end of the spotting session

**Temp Music**
* "Temporary music" added to film while still in production or early editing
* Often taken from other film scores, or "classical" music
* Gives more "finished" feeling to work in progress
* Composers are deeply divided on their view of temp music - why?
    * It makes directors kinda attached to their temp tracks
        * "I want you to do something that sounds like that"
        * Want you to write something as close to the temp track as
          possible without getting sued
    * Some composers like it because it gives them a clear idea of what they want

**Composing**
* 5 to 8 weeks until "delivery" of finished score
* Short timeline due to fixed release date
* Frequently exacerbated by production phase running overtime

**Orchestrators**
* Skilled in composition, music theory, and knowledge of the orchestra
    * Takes the composer's melodies and harmonies, and orchestrates it
        * Arranges it for orchestra
    * ex., knows the range of a trumpet, and all that shit

**Synth Demonstrations**
* People will mock up what the music will sound like in MIDI, but like good

**Copyist**
* Produce final parts for musicians
    * Takes the master score and separates it into percussion, clarinet 1, clarinet 2, etc.

**Music librarians**
* Organize sheet music and parts for recording sessions

**Conductors and studio musicians**
* Good sight readers (oof)
* Some composers conduct their own scores
    * To sync with the movie, they can play it while they perform?

**Mixing**
* Audio editing basically (kinda)
