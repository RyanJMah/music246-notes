    * 8 studios have come to dominate Hollywood
    * Studios hired actors and talent

    * Nazis scapegoat and marginalize the Jewish
        * Many Jewish artists retreat to North America
    * "Emigre" - immigrate

        * Easily sight-readable way to get musicians to play really fast lines
    * Irregular, aggressive accents
        * Unpredictable accents, uncertainty
    * Occasional motive reference
        * Motif reference
        * Reference a character's theme or whatever

* **Example 1: Opening Credits**
    * Uses an "overture" - ABA structure
        * Convention that came from opera
        * Introduces 2 to 3 motifs that you'll hear throughout the film
            * 1st theme is the protagonist's theme (heroic theme)
            * 2nd theme is the protagonist's love interest's theme (romantic theme)

            * Can do emotional expression easier than other sections
            * Vibrato, precise dynamic control, etc.
                * Kinda sounds like a human voice ish
        * A lot more delicate
        * Rubato
            * Tempo becomes a lot more loose
            * Way more expressive

<br>

* **Example 2: The Battle**
* Framing the Narrative (Phrasing the drama)
    * Sets mood and parallels the battle
    * As opposed to hitting the action, or playing the drama...
        * They can just provide a nice background (frame)
        * Can use if the scene is too chaotic to hit the action or whatever
* Music drops in level under dialog
    * Hits the thrown knife
    * Held notes when people are speaking
* Slows pacing under the "sounding" of the retreat
    * Blending of source and score with the sounding of the retreat
