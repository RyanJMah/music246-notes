### Planet of the Apes (1968), Music by Jerry Goldsmith

* "Probably the most modernist score ever written at this point" - Prof
    * The whole score is atonal

<br>

* Social and political critique
    * "It is a fairy tale, about us" - Prof
    * A commentary of racism

<br>

* Blend of orchestral instruments with elements, such as
  animal horns and mixing bowls
    * Literal kitchen bowls, hit by percussionists

<br>

* Prepared Piano
    * Pioneered by modernist composers in the 1950s
    * "An early attempt to create a synth out of an acoustic instrument" - Prof

<br>

**Scene: POTA - The Crossing (Part 1)**
* They land, and have to walk out of the desert (they are crossing the desert)
* No clear organization, more sound than music
* Use of electronic echo, metal sheet

**Scene: POT - The Crossing (Part 2)**
* Clear melodic structure using 12-tone technique
    * Arnold Schoenberg ("2nd Viennese School")
    * Treat all 12 notes with equal importance
    * A new set of rules to replace the major/minor system of tonality
    * **Tone Rows**
        * Developed in 1923
        * Number the 12 notes from 1 to 12
        * Come up with a pattern
            * Need to use all 12 notes, and can't repeat a note until
              all notes have been used
        * Can invert the tone row to come up with a completely new tone row

**Scene: POTA - The Takers**
* Music for the astronauts is atonal but strongly organized
* Clear, even rhythm supported by snare drum
* Music for unseen takers is chaotic
    * "Chirping woodwinds"
        * They're like squeaking and stuff lol
    * Log drums - more "primitive" sound
* Different characterizations but not dependent on tonality

**Scene: POTA - No Escape**
* The ONLY moment of tonal music in the film
    * Reserved for just after Taylor speaks to the apes for the first time
    * "One big F" - Prof
        * Like, the note

**Scene: POTA - The Ending**
* Talyor proves that before the apes were there, there were humans
    * The top apes were hiding this fact
* Regardless, the apes let them go
* There is no music at all
    * The scene is so effective because of the lack of music
    * The scene makes you feel really devastated
* There is no music in the credits either, just the sound of the waves

### Jerry Goldsmith (Cont.)
* 18 Academy Award nominations
    * Won in 1977 for "The Omen"
* Closely associated with the Star Trek franchise

## The 1970s

* "We have reached a point where modern music is more popular than tonal music"
* "Pop music is also more popular than tonal music"

<br>

* Film cost continues to increase
    * 1937: 538 films produced
    * 1970: 160 films per year
    * Hollywood becomes very cautious about making films
* Genre/formula films
    * "Films that have a built-in audience"
    * e.g., superhero movies
    * Sequels

<br>

* Peak of pop scores, many scores are just made of pre-made pop songs, cheaper
* Some good films with pop scores - Prof
    * The Graduate (1967)
    * Easy Rider (1969)
    * The Last Picture (1971)
    * American Graffiti (1973)
* Cheaper/promotion
* "Old school" (orchestras) are seen as irrelevant

## John Williams

* Born in 1932 to musical parents
* Trained as a concert pianist at Julliard
* Television (late 1950s)
    * Lost in Space, Land of the Giants, Gilligan's Island

<br>

* Late 1960s, film work - comedies and disaster films - Irwin Allen

<br>

**EXAMPLE: The Poseidon Adventure (1972), Music by John Williams**

**EXAMPLE: The Sugarland Express (1974), Music by John Williams**
* First time collaboration between John Williams and Steven Spielberg

### Jaws

* Jaws began a shift in the attitude towards orchestral music in film
* Helped re-established the orchestra as an important force in film music
    * A trend that will reach a peak with Star Wars two years later.

<br>

* Score is a blend of modernism (such as the influence of "The Rite of
  Spring" (1917) by Igor Stravinsky) and a return to the sound of Korngold
  (Neoromantic music)

<br>

* They had a mechanical shark that they used, it only worked half of the time
    * Spielberg shot the movie with the shark hidden most of the time,
      which was actually a good creative decision
        * Adds suspense

<br>

* **The shark theme**
    * John Williams sits at a piano and plays two chromatic notes lol
        * The theme has no beginning and no end
        * Can play it quietly, loudly, can speed up, etc.
        * "The theme itself can become the shark"

<br>

**Scene: Get Out of The Water**
* Shark theme enters with the underwater shot
* The theme rises in intensity before the attack
* Modernism Psycho-like strings during Brody's reaction
* Theme fades away telling us the shark has left

**Scene: The Fisherman**
* Shark theme enters as the tire is pulled out to sea
* Theme grows in intensity
* Note the change in intensity as the dock changes direction and returns to shore
* Again, the theme fades away, telling us the shark has left

**Scene: He made me do it**
* All of the visual elements from the first attack are present
* The one thing that is missing is the music
* The attack is a prank, but the tonly thing that is missing is the music
* By this point the music is clearly linked to the presence of the shark

**Scene: You're Gonna Need a Bigger Boat**
* The shark appears without musical warning
* It's very scary because it just kinda happens (jumpscare?)
* "Takes away the safety net of the music"

**Scene: The Barrels**
* Shark theme builds to first sight of the shark
* New theme - wonder / amazement / humility
    * Plays as the shark passes them

<br>

* Quint's theme - highly structured - deliberate - focused - controlled
    * Fisherman, just wants to kill the shark

<br>

* Hooper's theme - childlike - wonder - excitement
    * Oceanographer, fascinated

<br>

* Shark theme builds on to the harpoon shot
* "Pirate" music - exciting, uplifting, until the shark pulls
  the barrel under the water
    * Descends a scale and slows down when it sinks

This is the significance of Jaws:
* "We see John Williams with one foot in modernism and another in Romanticism"

### Star Wars (1977), Music by John Williams

* Marked a return to the orchestral style of Korngold
    * Temp track featured Korngold
    * Composed for standard orchestra
    * Use of tonal themes / thematic transformation
* This film changed everyone's mind about tonal orchestral film music

<br>

**Williams' Style**
* Influenced by both the traditional approaches of Wagner/Korngold as well as
  more recent modernist styles
* **Neoromantic**
    * Refers to the return of romantic inspired styles (neo-romantic lol)
    * Many elements from old romantic styles, with a bit of modernism
* No contemporary popular music, but capable of composing in Jazz-influenced styles
