## Lecture 9

## 1940

**EXAMPLE: Citizen Kane - The Breakfast Montage, Music By Bernard Herrmann**
* Heralded as one of the best movies ever
* Orson Wells
    * Had full creative control here
* Written for a standard orchestra, using major scale, etc.

**EXAMPLE: The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), Music by Bernard Herrmann**
* Unique set of instruments
    * Electric Violin
    * Electric Cello
    * Electric Bass
    * Two theremins
    * Three electric organs
    * Three vibraphones
    * Two glockenspiels
    * Two pianos
    * Two harps
    * Three trumpets
    * Three trombones
    * Four tubas

<br>

* "People write for symphony orchestras because they exist" - Prof
    * "Standardized performance ensemble"
* Every single city has a symphony orchestra
    * Very common
* There will always be an orchestra that can play the song
* Same idea with Jazz big bands, etc.

<br>

* Bernard realized: "Film music is not meant to be played in a concert"
    * It is recorded once for the film
    * If you live in Hollywood, you can write a score for whatever
      instrumentations you want, and you just need to record it once

**EXAMPLE: The Day the Earth Stood Still**
* About an alien who realizes we have nuclear weapons and how we can all die
  from them and how its kinda stupid

<br>

* "sound clouds" - music focusing on the textures, not melody
* Stops the music in sync with the gunshot

<br>

* Modernist approach
* Herrmann's approach:
    * The sound of a score depends on instrumentation
* Only required for recording session - no need to use a standardized
  performance ensemble

**1955 - Herrmann begins collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock**

**EXAMPLE: Vertigo**
* Ostinato is based off a dance
    * The dance is inspired by the feeling of being poisoned by a spider?? lol

### Psycho (1960), Music by Bernard Herrmann
* "This was the film that no one wanted to make" - prof
    * Deals with an un-married women who is having an affair, who
      is murdered later on in the story

<br>

* **Limited budget**
    * Shot in black and white
    * **Herrmann uses only strings**
        * "Black and white score"
        * "Because Hitchcock shot the movie in black and white,
           I'll do a black and white score"
        * Still leaves a lot of range...

<br>

* Cues tend to set a single mood and show little response to what happens
  minute by minute
    * **Entire score is framing the narrative**
* Overall, the mood is bleak and has little emotional warmth

**EXAMPLE: Psycho - The Money**
* Short repetitive thees that fractures
* Quiet but unsettled - Marion's discomfort with the theft
* Grows slightly in intensity as she decides to take the money

**EXAMPLE: Psycho - Flight**
* Music enters as she makes her "escape"
* At first seems to play her fear at being caught
* But as she changes, music seems to play her fall to the "dark" side

**EXAMPLE: Norman**
* Two semi-tones
* "Harmonies" as Norman spies on Marion, no emotion
    * "Harmonics" on violin are one of the coldest, creepiest tones
      you can make" - Prof
* Goes to plucked strings as he exits to the house

**EXAMPLE: Shower**
* No music until the attack
* No tonality - strings "shriek"
* Whose theme as the murder flees the scene?
    * Norman's theme

#### Falling Out
* Eventually, Hitchcock and Herrmann had a falling out
* Herrmann was a pretty disagreeable person
* He HATED the use of popular music in scores
    * **Torn Curtain (1964)**
    * Hitchcock told him that he wanted to use a pop song in a movie

<br>

* Bitter, he moves to Europe
    * Fruffaut: **Fahrenheit 451 (1966)**

<br>

* Last movie is **Taxi Driver (1975)**

**Herrmann is a composer of the 20th century.**

## 1960s

* Turbulent period in American history
    * Civil rights
    * Vietnam war
    * Generational gap

**Films in the 1960s**
* Cultural revolution of the late '60s results in films with a strong sense
  of irony and cynicism
* End of the studio system leads to freelancing and independent production
* Costs escalate
* While orchestral scores are still produced, cost factors lead to many
  smaller ensembles or popular music score

**During the 1960s**
* Continuing growth of popular music influences
* Continuing growth of use of dissonance, atonality

## John Barry
* Classical pianist / trumpet
* Turned to pop music in his 20s
* By early 1960s is a well-known British pop musician
    * Rock and roll

<br>

**How he got into scoring films:**
* Making of James Bond...
* Montey Norman is the current composer
    * He was good at writing pop songs, not film scores
* The film producers are panicking, one of them knows John Barry
    * He has a few days
    * He writes a few things then they just put it all over the film
* John Barry writes the main James Bond theme

James Bond does so well that John Barry goes on to compose for the next
11 James Bond films.

<br>

**EXAMPLE: Dr. No (1962)**
* James Bond
* Monty Norman
* Law Suit
    * Montey Norman owned the rights to the James Bond scores contractually
    * John Barry tried to sue him
    * Montey Norman won lol

**Won 5 Academy Awards**
* Born Free (1967)
* Out of Africa (1986)
* Daces with Wolves (1991)

**Style defined by clear, tonal melodies (pop influence).**

## Jerry Goldsmith (1929 - 2004)

* Born in Los Angeles
* *Spellbound*
    * "Fell in love with film music when he was 10 years old"
    * He saw Spellbound composed by [I forget] and knew he wanted to compose film music
* Studied with Miklos Rosza at USC
    * We are now at a period of time where Universities offer courses
      on how to compose film scores
* Starts working at CBS radio in 1950
    * Fresh out of school
    * Many composers start out with radio
* Gradually doing more work for television
    * TVs are now becoming a dominant medium
    * Starts off as an under the table kinda thing
    * Becomes legit after he writes some stuff and people liked it
* Film work starts in 1957

#### Patton
* A war movie
    * Dramatized account of an American General
* Sparse score (less than 40 minutes) for a 3 hour film
* Music focuses on the character of Patton
* Uses electronic processing on orchestral instruments

<br>

* Patton was very Christian, also believed in reincarnation
    * He believed that he had been reincarnated many times before,
      each time as a war hero...

<br>

* Reincarnation theme expanded during his description
    * Trumpet plays 3 notes
* Hymn theme enters as Patton says - "two thousand years ago"
    * Simple, like hymns often are
    * Christian reference to the time of Christ

**EXAMPLE: Patton - North Africa**
* "Sound cloud" as they arrive at the battlefield
* Electronic echo on trumpet in reincarnation theme

**EXAMPLE: Patton - Advance in Europe**
* Montage - blending of all three themes
* March theme accompanies Patton and advancing troops
* Religious theme accompanies the commanding officers
* Reincarnation theme when we see the list of German casualties
