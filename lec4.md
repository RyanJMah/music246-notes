### Transition to Sound

Solution to the problems of musical accompaniment - recorded and synchronized sound.

* Sound and silent films existed together for years
* Economic issues
    * Many theatres were broke af
    * People who owned nickelodeons didn't have the means
* "talkies" were initially seen as a fad
    * People had a pre-conception of films as silent
    * Rejected it, "got to a play if u wanna hear people talk"

<br>

* Demonstrations of sound films as early as 1922
* Several competing systems emerge - two primary approaches
    1. Sound on Film: (Phonofilm, Movietone)
        * Photograph of sound waves on the edge of film
            * Literally like the analog waveform lol
            * Analog photoelectric effect, induce voltage into speaker
        * Excellent synchronization
            * Since it was attached to the film
        * Poor audio quality (duh)
    2. Sound on Disk: (Warner Brothers' Vitaphone)
        * Audio recording on a phograph disk, synchronized with the film projector
        * Excellent audio
        * Poor synchronization
            * Frequency of disk spin was not very accurate
                * People had to like manually slow them down to sync and shit

#### 1926: Don Juan
* First mainstream film to record and play sound for it's whole length
* Recorded score primarily by William Axt, performed by New York Philharmonic Orchestra
* Vitaphone
    * Recorded music and some sound effects
    * No Dialog, still a silent film
        * Cus vitaphone had synchronization issues
        * Synching a whole film's dialog was considered impossible
* Also had a second score created for "live" performances, why?
    * It could be played at places without vitaphones as well

#### Example: The Jazz Singer (1927) - Blue Skies
* Largely considered as the "first" significant "talking" motion picture
* Primarily silent, with several minutes of synchronized sound
    * Long clips of him singing and playing piano
* Made use of the Vitaphone System
* Why is it still primarily a silent film?
* A financial hit
* Signaled the "beginning of the end" of the silent era

<br>

Sound on Disk has the early lead, but Sound on Film will become the standard by the early 1930s.

### Changes Connected to Sound

For example, no one was writing dialog before. Hollywood needs to hire script writers.

1. Aesthetics
    * Film had developed visually as a silent mdeium
    * Acting styles / voices
        * Facial expressional acting becomes less exaggerated
        * Some of them had annoying voices I guess lol
    * Many worried about using non-diegetic music
        * "Where does the sound come from?"
        * They came up with excuses for there to be background music
            * ex., a violin player on screen
        * Thought people would be confused

<br>

2. Making Films
    * Technical challenges
        * "Overdubbing" does not exist yet
        * They had to play the music, on set, while they were filming
        * All done through a single mic
        * Cameras in large booths - no movement
            * Cameras were noisy
            * There were in soundproof booths
            * The booth can't move, no panning shots or anything
        * "Sound stages" are built to reduce outside noises

<br>

3. Showing Films
    * Too many contesting sound systems
    * Small number of the 20,000 theatres equipped for sound
    * End of 1929 almost 1000 theatres equipped for sound
    * By 1935, the transition is complete

### Max Steiner (1888-1971)
* Born in Vienna, middle class, father owned a theatre
    * "Anyone who is anyone in European classical music eventually ends up in Vienna"
    * His family is comfy middle class
    * He grows up in the world of opera
* Formally trained in the tradition of European classical music
    * Studied composers like Wagner in music school
* Child prodigy
    * Graduates university at 10
    * Conducting theatre by 12
    * Touring as a conductor by 16
* Wrote operettas, first by 17
* Worked as a composer and conductor of music for stage in England

<br>

Faces deportation in England because of WWI
* Vienna is in Austria, who were against England
    * Max Steiner was in England when the war started
    * He was an "enemy alien"
* He flees to US in 1914 with a small suitcase
    * Arrives in New York, needs money
    * Worked on Broadway for 15 years

<br>

* Problems with actors' voices - Hollywood turns to Broadway
    * Broadway is full of actors with great voices
    * They would just make movie versions of musicals, with the existing cast
* Invited to Hollywood in 1929
    * Max was the musical producer and director of a musical: Rio Rita
    * He's very impressed with the quality of the musicians, and Hollywood is impressed with Max

By 1930, little music is used in dramatic films - "where does it come from?"

**Example: Cimarron (1931) Score by Max Steiner**
* "Introduced" music as source music (in the film), but would change the vibe to fit the action
* David Selznick, at RKO recognized that more music might be effective, despite risk of confusing the audience
    * Told Max this too

**(1932) Symphony of 6 Million** and **Bird of Paradise**
* David Selznick gave Max two films to score
    * Tells him to write a **"Wall to Wall Score"**
        * Like what was present in silent movies
* Audience was not confused

### King Kong (1933)
* Worried that it would be a flop
    * Was supposed to be a horror movie, but the audience laughed at it
* Max Steiner was asked to compose a score at the last minute
    * After his score was added, the audience was scared

<br>

* Video Example: King Kong - The Fog
    * This is basically the first movie with a non-diegetic score
        * No pre-established conventions
        * Max Steiner is basically making up the "rules" as he goes
    * Music used to indicate a transition from the normal world to the realm of the supernatural
        * Using music to indicate transitions will become a convention later
    * Music is uncertain, quiet, reinforcing the mystery of what lies ahead

### Example: The Informer (1935) - Max Steiner
* Opening
    * Leitmotifs
        * Folk-influenced theme for Gypo
        * Jazz-Influenced theme for Katie
    * Musical Quotes
        * "Rule Britannia"
* Won academy award for "best musical scor"
* Max Steiner's sound:
    * Loves "the Mickey Mouse"
        * Hits the action in extremely dramatic fashion

### Max Steiner (Cont.)
* Other notable films: 
    * Gone With the Wind (1939)
    * Casablanca (1942)
    * A Summer Place (1959)
* Most of his career - head of music at Warner Bros. (1937-1953)
* Most of his important work is during the 1930s to the early 1950s
* Workaholic
    * Contributed to over 300 film scores during his career
* Died in 1971
