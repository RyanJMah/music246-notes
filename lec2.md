## Evaluating a score

### Key terms and concepts
* **Diegesis**
    * The world of the narrative
    * All characters, events, etc depicted, suggested or described
* Diegetic Music / Source Music
    * Music whose source is within the Diegesis
    * Heard both by the characters within the narrative and the film audience
    * Also known as "source music", "direct music", or "foreground music"
    * Functions
        * Establishing time and place
            * e.g., listening to lizzo lol
        * Creating a sense of "realism and immediacy"
        * Offering ironic comment
            * e.g., People fighting to the death bump into a jukebox
              and it plays a happy song

<br>

* **Non-diegetic Music / Score**
    * Heard by the film audience only
        * Not heard by the characters in the film, but heard by audience
    * Referred to as the "score", "underscore", or "background music"
    * Normally originally composed for the specific film (original score)

<br>

* May also include pieces of pre-existing music selected to accompany the scene
    * Pre-existing - Music was composed before the film was made
    * They will even structure the scene around the piece of music
    * Examples:
        * Platoon (1986) Composer: George Deleure
        * Adagio for Strings (1938): Samuel Barber

<br>

* Adapted Score
    * All pre-existing music adapted for the film

<br>

* Compiled Score
    * All pre-existing music, used without adaptation
    * e.g., 2001: A Space Odyssey
        * Compiled from the works of R. Stauss, J Strauss, etc...

### Describing the music

* **Style**
    * What type of music has the composer chosen
        * What is the style?
            * Electronic? Orchestral?
            * Cultural background?
    * What type of instruments?
    * How do these choices relate to the film as a whole?

<br>

* **Example: Restoration (1995) Composer: James Newton Howard**
    * Score is part original part adapted, based on the work of Henry Purcell
    * Very baroque
        * Movie is about like medival shit
    * There were moments where he incorporates more contemporary styles
        * Still manages to incorporate the style of Henry Purcell

<br>

* **Example: Local Hero (1983) Composer: Mark Knopfler**
    * Knopfler developed melodies similar to Anglo Celtic folk music
        * Incorporates common bagpipe ornaments with other instruments

<br>

* **Example: The Godfather (1972) Composer: Nino Rota**
    * Film opens with a solo trumpet
        * Solo - sense of isolation, being on your own
        * The Godfather is like a lonley figure
    * Transitions into a waltz with guitar accompaniment
        * The movie starts at his daughter's wedding, waltz reflects that
            * A dance
            * He opens in the style of a silician wedding

### Conceptual Approaches

* Most film music will fall somewhere between two extremes:
    1. Playing the drama
        * Music attempts to reinforce primarily emotional elements within the narrative
    2. Hitting the action
        * Music accents visual events
* Most music will do both at the same time.

<br>

* **Example: How to Train Your Dragon (2010)**
    * Original score composed by John Powell
    * NOTE:
        * PTD - playing the drama
        * HTA - hitting the action
    * "Test Drive"
        * (00:35) PTD main theme as they begin the dive - builds excitement
        * (00:48) overhead shot - music “swells” as they fly through the arch
        * (00:54) HTA as they bump into the rock
        * (01:16) HTA as the cheat sheet becomes loose. PTD Music
          becomes nightmarish as they fall
        * (01:49) HTA as the wings open – return to first theme as the regain control.
        * (01:57) Hiccup throws away the cheat sheet – PTD grandest
          statement of main theme at this point – why?

### Musical Characteristics
1. **Melody or Theme**
    * Considered the most "recognizable" music element for western ears
    * Do characters, objects, or situations have a particular melody
      associated with them?
    * German Opera composer Richard Wagner - Leitmotif
        * Theme associated with a certain character
    * Thematic Transformation - leitmotif undergo constant variation
      in response to narrative development

* **Example: Star Wars (1977) Music composed by John Williams**
    * Luke's Theme - also the main theme for the film
        * The opening credits theme
    * Thematic Transformation
        * We hear it again the first time we hear the name "Luke"
            * We hear his leitmotif
            * There's an innocence to it
        * Plays again when they're escaping from death star
            * Sense of playfulness
        * Plays again when the only hope is Luke hitting the thing
          with the torpedo
            * Very dissonant, dramatic

<br>

2. **Tempo or Pulse**
    * How does the speed of the music influence the “tempo” of the
      narrative? On-screen action, editing, sound design

* **Example: The Return of the King (2004) composed by Howard Shore**
    * Music plays against the expectation for a battle scene
    * Also an excellent example of music blurring the line between
      source music and score
        * Reinforces the idea that this is a suicide mission
        * A character is singing a song for a bit, then the
          orchestra comes in sounding like a nightmare

<br>

3. **Harmony**
    * Chords
    * Consonant/dissonant, orderly/chaotic, tonal/atonal
        * Consonant - based on major scale (kinda?)

* **Example: *Main Theme* from Cider House Rules (1999) composed by Rachael Portman**
    * Highly consonant and tonal
        * Everything in major scale
* **Example: *Yes* from Meet Joe Black (1998) composed by Thomas Newman**
    * Blend of consonant and dissonant
        * Some non-functional harmony
        * Mysterious
* **Example: *Bishop's Countdown* from Aliens (1986) composed by James Horner**
    * Extremely dissonant
        * Timpani is spamming the tritone lol
    * You can hear exactly when they're gonna escape
        * Switches to functional harmony for a brief sec, plays a major chord

### Relation to European/Western Classical Music
* Baroque Era (1600-1750)
    * Vivaldi, Handle, Bach
    * Very regal formal bullshit
        * Even tempos, consistent textures, terraced dynamics
        * Following the rules
            * Emotion was less important
    * Beginning of the "Common Practice Period"
        * Musicians settled on the 12-tone system and the major scale
          (minor scale as well)
    * Not good for films
        * Need more dynamic changes, tempo changes, and stuff that's interesting
* Classical Period (1730-1820)
    * Mozart, Hayden, Beethoven
    * Greater focus on melody and emotion
    * Expanding variety of tempo, texture and dynamics
    * Way better for film
* Romantic Period (1800-1910)
    * Wagner, Tchaikovsky, Strauss
    * Expression of emotion was most important
    * Even greater range of tempo, texture, and dynamics in service of
      emotion and narrative
    * Sounds right out of a movie score
        * More like film scores sound like romantic era music
        * Motion pictures are invented in 1895
            * The film composers are going to be people who learned
              about Wagner in music school
